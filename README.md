# Voting-System-API
This project is a voting system for restaurants. Users can vote for their favorite restaurant each day, with a deadline for changing their vote. Administrators can manage restaurants and their menu items (dishes). The system provides a REST API for interacting with these features, ensuring data persistence and user security.
